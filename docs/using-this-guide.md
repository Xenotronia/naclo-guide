  <p style="margin-top: 50px;">This guide does not serve as a syllabus! It features topics from prior NACLO problems and does not necessarily predict future ones. The NACLO may present problems involving topics not discussed.</p>

Due to the lack of widely-available NACLO resources, this guide aims to be a place where beginners can learn about the contest and contestants can hone their skills on the various topics the NACLO covers.

Throughout this guide, we will cover various topics that are tested in NACLO, such as morphology, syntax, semantics, and computational problems. We will also provide helpful tips and strategies for approaching NACLO problems and suggest additional resources for further study.

So, whether you are a high school student interested in competing in NACLO, a teacher looking to incorporate computational linguistics into your curriculum, or simply someone interested in the fascinating world of language technology, we hope you find this guide informative and useful.

## How to Use This

- Many sections contain **problems** which you should solve. Some of these problems are marked with a star (★), and we *strongly* recommend you try them out.
- The sections are essentially independent, so you can proceed them in any order you wish.
- However, it is recommended that you start with the sections that introduce the basics of the contest before moving on to more advanced topics.
- In addition to the problems included in this guide, we also recommend that you practice with additional [past NACLO problems](https://www.nacloweb.org/practice.php).

## The Types of Problems

There are three general "categories" of problems which this guide is divided into.

- **Common** problems are the types of problems that you would expect "most" problems to be; there are usally 2-4 of each type across both rounds.
- **Likely** problems are the unique types of problems that usually appear in each contest, but not multiple times; there are usually 1 of each type across both rounds.
- **Rare** problems have only historically appeared a few times, and perhaps never in recent contests.
