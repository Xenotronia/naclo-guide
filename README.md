NACLO Guide â€” the premier resource for linguistics olympiads, open for all to contribute.

## Contributing information

We're so excited that you're interested in contributing to the NACLO Guide! All pages have an "Edit on GitHub" button you can use to edit the raw Markdown file directly, from which Github will give you instructions to complete your pull request.

Alternatively, if you want to do it the old-fashioned way or are working on a larger section, you can make a pull request from a local clone:

1. Fork the repository: Visit the [NACLO Guide repository](https://github.com/arulkolla/naclo-guide) and click on the "Fork" button in the top right corner. This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.
2. Clone the repository: Go to your forked repository and click on the "Clone or download" button. Copy the HTTPS link and use the command `git clone <HTTPS link>` in your terminal to clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch: Use the command `git checkout -b <new-branch-name>` to create a new branch for your changes. It's important to make changes in a separate branch so that it doesn't affect the main branch.
4. Make changes: Make the desired changes to the appropriate Markdown files in the `docs` folder in your local repository using a text editor or IDE. Please ensure that your changes are consistent with the NACLO Guide's formatting and style guide.
5. Commit changes: Once you're satisfied with your changes, use the command `git add .` to stage your changes. Then, use the command `git commit -m "<commit-message>"` to commit your changes with a meaningful commit message.
6. Push changes to your fork: Use the command `git push origin <new-branch-name>` to push your changes to your forked repository.
7. Create a pull request: Go to your forked repository on GitHub and click on the "New pull request" button. Select the main branch of the original repository as the base branch and your newly created branch as the compare branch. Give your pull request a meaningful title and description, and then click on "Create pull request".

That's it! Your pull request will be reviewed by the NACLO Guide maintainers, and they may ask for changes or request additional information before merging your changes into the main branch.
